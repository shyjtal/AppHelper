apphlper will export the app and it's dependencies
you need write dependencies in app root dir
dependencies:
    if sh, just write: sh_name
    if tool, write: tool/sh_name
    if homebrew, write: brew/app_name

if use -dev
    ah -dev $sh_name [-m $commit_content]
    ah -dev $sh_name add ... [-m $commit_content]
